# EIO-2024-Solutions

this repo’s just us messing around with the Estonian Informatics Olympiad 2024 problems.
not official, not perfect — just our own takes, notes, and code dumps while trying to figure stuff out.

💭 why we did this
needed a place to throw our solutions

wanted to actually understand the problems, not just brute-force them

wrote some comments so future-us wouldn’t get lost reading our own code

occasionally tried dumb ideas just to see what happens

if that sounds useful to you, cool — poke around.

🧑‍💻 who this is for
us, mainly

maybe you, if you’re into informatics olympiads or CP stuff

anyone who prefers rough, real code over cleaned-up contest writeups

-------------------------------------------------------
not optimized for speed or elegance — more for learning

some comments are just us thinking out loud

may or may not contain spaghetti
